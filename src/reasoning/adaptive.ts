// src/reasoning/adaptive.ts — Deterministic, config-driven selector for the
// `adaptive` policy mode.
//
// This module owns ALL automatic level-selection logic. The function is pure:
// no IO, no module-level state, no side effects. Given the same signals and
// policy, it returns the same decision every time — that is the contract.
//
// Decision order (first match wins; see `selectAdaptiveLevel` below):
//
//   1. `policy.adaptive` is absent                 → null  (no adaptive config)
//   2. `signals.isTrivial` is true                 → adaptive.trivialLevel ?? null
//   3. `adaptive.tierDefaults[signals.tierName]`   → that level (wins over default)
//   4. `adaptive.keywordRules` (array order)       → first rule whose keywords
//                                                   match in prompt OR description
//                                                   (case-insensitive substring)
//   5. catch-all                                   → adaptive.defaultLevel ?? null
//
// `null` at every step means "no patch" — the caller leaves the agent def at
// its baseline. The resolver (`policy.ts`) is responsible for translating the
// selected level through the tier's capability; this module only picks the
// level. Keeping the translation out of here means the selector is decoupled
// from provider-specific reasoning channels and stays trivially testable.

 * - `prompt` and `description` MUST be lowercased before being passed in.
 *   Keyword matching is case-insensitive substring matching, so the selector
 *   itself does not re-lowercase — keeping it cheap to call and predictable
 *   to test.
 * - `tierName` is the dispatcher tier name (e.g. "medium", "heavy"). Looked
 *   up against `AdaptivePolicyConfig.tierDefaults`.
 * - `isTrivial` is the dispatch-time trivial classification result. Sourced
 *   from the session store.
